## Getting started
If you want to mess around with it by yourself follow these steps.
1. you will need npm and node js from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
then open a command prompt and type
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
2. Then you can clone the repo and install the dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/MatthiasHerzog2000/firestore-image-sharing.git
cd *foldername*
npm install
```
3. Next open the folder in your favourite Code Editor e.g. [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. There you need to replace the `const config` in *firebase/firebase.js* with your own credentials which you'll get here [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/). A good tutorial is here [Add Firebase to your JS Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
5. Then open a command prompt and type and the project should start up
```
npm start
```
